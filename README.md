A computational framework for analyzing Complex Adaptive Systems, based on the research paper "Dynamic Resonance Rooting: A Computational Framework for Complex Adaptive Systems" by Christopher Woodyard.

# Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR) â€“ Official Implementation

**Dynamic Resonance Rooting (DRR)** is an advanced computational framework designed to analyze complex adaptive systems (CAS) through the identification of dominant oscillatory patterns (resonances) and the underlying causal structures that drive system behavior.

## Overview
The DRR framework aims to provide:
- **Real-time signal detection** from time-series data,
- **Rooting analysis** to identify causal and hierarchical dependencies within the system,
- **Resonance Depth (RD)** as an early-warning metric for system instability or critical transitions.

## Features:
- **Signal Detection**: Using spectral analysis and phase-space reconstruction.
- **Causal Modeling**: Maps the underlying causes of system behavior via transfer entropy.
- **Resonance Depth**: A stability metric to detect critical transitions.
- **Visualizations**: Real-time graphs, resonance depth evolution, and symbolic field representations.
  
## Key Benefits:
- **Real-time System Monitoring**: Adaptable to various domains including finance, healthcare, and defense.
- **Dynamic Forecasting**: Predictive analysis of system stability and risk.
- **Scalable**: Can be implemented in both small-scale research projects and large, real-time operational systems.

## Use Cases:
- **Military & Defense**: Monitoring the resilience of complex defense systems and forecasting system failures.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting and mitigating critical health events like cardiac arrhythmias or neurological disorders.
- **Finance**: Detecting market crashes or systemic risk in economic systems.
